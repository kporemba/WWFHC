            <h2>SUMMARY</h2>
                <p>Waterloo Womenâ€™s Field Hockey Team offers coaching clinics to become certified. There is also a variety of opportunities to coach within the organisation. Coaching is vital to keeping field hockey alive in Canada. You can show your love for the game you grew up with, and provide the opportunity for others to learn, and play too. Becoming a coach can help you further develop leadership, and organisational skills. It can help you become more connected to athletes, and sports businesses within the Kitchener Waterloo region. It is a great opportunity to give back and become more involved in your region. There are also paid coaching opportunities at the provincial and national level- you can start working towards that today.</p>
