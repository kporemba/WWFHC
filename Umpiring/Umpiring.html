        <h2>SUMMARY</h2>
            <p>Waterloo Womenâ€™s Field Hockey Team offers umpiring clinics to become certified by Field Hockey Ontario. As an organisation, we are required to staff each game with an umpire. They are paid and by an as-needed basis. There is also a variety of opportunities to umpire across the region once certified.</p>
        
        <h2>CERTIFICATION</h2>
            <p>The umpire certification program is developed and owned by Field Hockey Canada (FHC). Training and certification are managed and delivered by the provincial association. To find the rules for field hockey Ontario click <a href=http://www.fih.ch/inside-fih/our-official-documents/rules-of-hockey>here</a>.</p>
